The project is also hosted under domain: https://portfolio-gosia.pl/ - as I wanted to test mail.php
This project is not a real portfolio - it's an University project prepared by Ma≈Çgorzata Szymanik. Information in this portfolio as well as examples of websites are not real.
All code was written by myself based on the knowledge gained from online courses on Udemy and some examples on Youtube.
The images/logos were generated with the use of AI tool - Freepick.
Fonts imported from https://fonts.google.com/ as well as https://fontawesome.com/.
Light box script from https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/ used in creating pop-up gallery.
This website has some basic responsiveness for mobile and tablet devices.
